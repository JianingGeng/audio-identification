# Developer Guide


## Project Structure

- `myapp/`: Django app containing views, models, and templates.
  - `views.py`: Contains the views for handling web requests. Manages the interaction between the front end and the back end.
  - `models.py`: Defines the data models. This is where the structure of the database is defined.
  - `forms.py`: Contains Django forms for handling user input, specifically for uploading audio files.
    - **Usage**: Used to generate HTML forms and handle file uploads securely.
  - `task.py`: Contains asynchronous tasks powered by Celery, used for handling longer-running processes such as audio processing that shouldn't block the main thread.
  - `audio_processor.py`: Handles the core functionality of processing audio files, such as extracting features or identifying specific audio patterns.
    - **Usage**: Called by views or tasks to perform complex audio analysis and processing.

- `myproject/`: Contains the Django project settings.
  - `settings.py`: Manages settings and configurations like database connection info, Django apps configuration, middleware, etc.
  - `urls.py`: Defines the URLs of the project that are linked to views for routing web requests.

### Detailed Description of Key Components

#### `forms.py`
This module primarily through file uploads. These forms are used within the views to handle incoming data securely and efficiently.

#### `task.py`
This module utilizes Celery to define tasks that could run asynchronouslyï¼Œ the default is not run asynchronously if you need to processing large amount of audio files could switch to asynchronously.

#### `audio_processor.py`
The `audio_processor.py` file is crucial for the functionality of the application as it contains all the logic needed to handle and process audio data.
